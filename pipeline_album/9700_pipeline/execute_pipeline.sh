# GOTCHA: Invoke pipeline steps so that $0 is set to their full path, since each step assumes
#       $0 refers to that pipeline step's script. This means that:
#       1. Invoke the script directly, not by using the 'source' command
#       2. Invoke them via their full path
#       3. To ensure environment variables referenced here are set, the caller should have invoked this script using 'source'
